![library](https://github.com/SriSurya-DA/Library_Database_Management_SQL/blob/main/library%20management%20system.jpg)

## Overview

Database: library_db

This project demonstrates the development and implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It covers the creation and management of tables, execution of CRUD operations, and the application of advanced SQL queries. The primary objective is to highlight proficiency in database design, data manipulation, and complex query execution for efficient library management.

## Objective

- Demonstrate proficiency in database design, management, and querying
- Showcase the use of advanced SQL techniques for data manipulation and reporting
- Ensure smooth and efficient management of library operations through well-structured database queries

## Key Features

### Database Setup

Create a relational database library_db with the necessary tables:

- Branches for managing branch details
- employees to store employee information (including branch affiliation)
- members for library members
- issued_status to track books issued to members
- return_status to track the returned books

### CRUD Operations

Implement CRUD operations to manage data effectively

- **Create**: Add new records to each table
- **Read**: Retrieve records using various queries to display library data
- **Update**: Modify existing records as needed (e.g., updating member details or book status)
- **Delete**: Remove records (e.g., deleting a book or a member's account)

### CTAS (Create Table As Select)

Use CTAS to generate new tables from existing data based on specific query results, allowing for more efficient data management and reporting
